<h6 align="center">I build <strong>real-time systems</strong> and <strong>tools that run unattended</strong>—from Discord bots and chat servers to browser extensions and competitive-programming solutions. I like projects where <strong>performance, reliability, and security</strong> actually matter.</h6>

## What I’m focused on
- **Systems & Security:** auth flows, encrypted storage, safe-by-default design, deployment scripts
- **Product-minded engineering:** features users notice (chat UX, moderation tooling, progressive enhancement)
- **Algorithmic rigor:** USACO-style constraint-driven problem solving in C++
