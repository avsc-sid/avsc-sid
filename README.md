<h6 align="left">I build <strong>real-time systems</strong> and <strong>tools that run unattended</strong>—from Discord bots and chat servers to browser extensions and competitive-programming solutions. I like projects where <strong>performance, reliability, and security</strong> actually matter.</h6>

## What I’m focused on
- **Systems & Security:** auth flows, encrypted storage, safe-by-default design, deployment scripts
- **Product-minded engineering:** features users notice (chat UX, moderation tooling, progressive enhancement)
- **Algorithmic rigor:** Hackathon-style constraint-driven problem solving in C++

## Featured Projects

### 🎯 Summer Project - Statistical Model to Predict Treatment Protocol *(Python)*
Using anonymized dataset of 4,600 fertility-treatment patient records, I built an end-to-end predictive modeling pipeline in Python leveraging on libraries *pandas and scikit-learn.*
- Clean + standardize data columns (dates, units, categories)
- Privacy-Safe Steps - Anonymize / De-identify (remove names/IDs, shift dates, bucket ages)
- Handle missingness (patterns, imputation options, “missing-not-at-random” flags)
- Create analysis-ready tables (patients, clinicals, cycles, treatment, outcomes)
- Engineer features (AMH/AFC buckets, stimulation response, patient monitoring)
- Define outcomes (clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, live birth, miscarriage)
- Quality checks (duplicates, impossible values, cross-field consistency)
- Output: clean CSV/Parquet + data dictionary + QC report (and optionally baseline descriptive stats)

### 🗨️ SkyChatServer-RUST (full-stack chat platform)
A product-style chat system that's a successor to `ChatServer-RUST` with real features and a clear roadmap:
- members page, built-in chat, auto message loading, reply support
- login/register with admin approval, dynamic settings
- security-minded approach (client-side password hashing + server rehashing)
- practical setup + deployment notes

### 🔐 ChatServer-RUST (secure chat server)
A Rust chat server emphasizing security and robustness:
- encrypted DB file storage (AES-256), hashed passwords (SHA-512)
- HTTP + gzip support, IP/request filtering  
Repo: https://github.com/avsc-sid/ChatServer-RUST

### 🤖 DiscordBots (multi-bot ecosystem; Python / JS / Rust)
A collection of Discord bots and iterations of “SkyBot” across languages:
- guild tooling + virtual currency + fun commands + leveling + music
- multiple generations (Python / JS) + Rust pre-release rewrite  
Repo: https://github.com/avsc-sid/DiscordBots

### 🧰 SaveLocalWebsiteResources-JS (Chromium extension)
A browser extension (with DevTools panel UI) to download/save a website’s resources.  
Repo: https://github.com/avsc-sid/SaveLocalWebsiteResources-JS

### ⚙️ BingRewards-AutoSearch (C# Windows service)
A Windows service that schedules automated browser sessions/jobs for Bing searches.
